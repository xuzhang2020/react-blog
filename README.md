## First Single Page Application - ReactJS


### About making the project


This project is react single web page application.In the project, I used React, Sass, Node.js and Gulp.<br />

React routing technology is used to achieve the page routing of the home page and blog details page.

	[import {  Route,  NavLink,  HashRouter} from "react-router-dom";]
	[<HashRouter>]
		[<Route exact path="/" component={a js file name}/>]
		[<Route path="/route name" component={another js file name}/>]
	[</HashRouter>]
	
See [Main.js] file for more information about the react routing technology.

React props and state is used to pass and receive parameters among pages.

Pass parameters:

	[<div className="card-body" style={styles[post.id%3]}>
	  <Link to={{pathname: '/Detail',state:{title:post.title,img:post.pic,content:post.content}}}><h4>{post.title}</h4></Link>
	  <h3>{post.postdate}</h3>
	</div>]
	
Receive and use parameters:		  

	[<h2 className="title">{this.props.location.state.title}</h2>
	<div>
		  <img src={require('./images/' + this.props.location.state.img)}></img>
	</div>]

Sass technology and scss files is used to manage the css styles of page elements.
See [Style.scss] file for more information about the react routing technology.

The Google News API, react timer and AJAX technology is used to display Google news headlines in a div. The content of the div updates every 5 seconds.

	[this.timer = setInterval(function () {
		axios.get('http://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=google-news&apiKey=keyvaluee')
		.then(function (response) {
			console.log(response);
			
			this.setState({
				articles: response.data.articles
			});
		}.bind(this));
	}.bind(this), 5000);]
See [Nav.js] file for more information.
